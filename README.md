NeuroNexus is a repository that houses two C++ programming projects designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts. These projects are a console-based Tic Tac Toe game and a To-Do List manager.

## 1. Tic Tac Toe Game

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic console-based implementation with a user-friendly outcome. Players can enjoy a simple yet engaging gaming experience. The game is designed to run in a console environment, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with. It includes features such as error handling and a clear display of the game board.

### How to Play

To play the Tic Tac Toe game, simply run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions. Players take turns to make their move by entering the position where they want to place their symbol (X or O). The game will determine the winner or declare a draw based on the moves made by the players.

## 2. To-Do List Manager

The To-Do List manager is a console-based application that helps users create and manage their to-do lists. It utilizes text files to store and organize tasks, providing a simple and efficient way to keep track of daily activities.

### Features

- **Task Creation:** Users can add tasks to the to-do list by entering task details such as title, description, and due date.
- **Task Display:** The application displays the list of tasks along with their details, making it easy for users to review and manage their to-do items.
- **Task Modification:** Users can edit and update task details as needed.
- **Task Deletion:** Completed or unnecessary tasks can be removed from the list, helping users maintain a clean and organized to-do list.

### Usage

1. Run the To-Do List manager executable.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to create, view, modify, or delete tasks.
